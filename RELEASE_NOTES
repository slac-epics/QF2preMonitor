Release: R0-0-0
         Initial release at SLAC.
	 Author: Eric Norum
	 Modifications made by Sonya Hoobler to integrate
	   into LCLS-II: 
	   QF2preMonitorApp/Db: Make QF2preMonitorLCLS2.substitutions,
              tailored to LCLS-II conventions. Modify 
              existing database and substitutions files to 
              support this (but in such a way that no PV names changed).
          QF2preMonitorApp/srcArchive: Add archiving configs for LCLS-II
